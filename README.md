# jenkins-php-deployment
Automated Jenkins pipeline to deploy a basic PHP application.   The pipeline clones the code from GitHub, performs a PHP syntax check, and deploys the application to a web server directory.   It showcases best practices for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) using Jenkins, Git, and a local or remote server.
